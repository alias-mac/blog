Adding a route manually can be necessary sometimes. When on Linux, I know the
command by heart:

```bash
# ip addresses just for example
sudo route add -net 10.67.0.0/16 gw 192.168.120.254
```

On the OS X the command is similar, but a bit different ðŸ™‚

Just as a note to myself and anyone else interested:

```bash
sudo route -n add -net 10.67.0.0/16 192.168.120.254
```

This sets up a route to the `10.67.0.0/16` net through gateway
`192.168.120.254`.

To see an overview of current routes use:

```bash
netstat -nr
```
