For those of you that have at least 2 Macs (like I do), it's great to have just one keyboard and mouse to rule them all ðŸ™‚

For that, there is a special, easy to use and configure app that can do that for you. It's called [teleport](http://www.abyssoft.com/software/teleport/) and it's the best thing around for macs.

For those of you that don't have macs, or if you need to connect to a machine that isn't a mac, you can use the [Synergy](http://synergy-foss.org) app that does that very well. It's a little bit harder to configure, but once it's done, you will never want to look back!

Pick one and get that think working for extra productivity.
