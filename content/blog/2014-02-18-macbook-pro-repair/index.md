Today I decided to fix an old MacBook Pro 15" with my wife.

The Mac wasn't booting, no boot chime and had a solid sleep light always on when we tried to turn it on.
There was some information that we found on the internet about a possible Nvidia issue that needed reballing.

We don't have any tools to do reballing and clearly this isn't a quick easy and cheap fix.

Anyway, like I said, it is an old Macintosh and there is nothing to loose.

We searched a bit more on the internet and decided to do it without the [oven method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztzv2OlQJuU), instead we decided to use the [heat gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP4HwYD9LaQ).

The methods are similar, but we prefer to use the oven to make cookies ðŸ™‚

An important thing we had in mind was the [temperature that solder melts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solder). Using a laser thermometer that we got cheap, we kept checking the temperature to see if it was a bit higher than the melting point (around 190Âº to 200ÂºC). We did it like the video shows - about 10 min across the several chips (including the graphic card). After it was done, we waited for the board to cool (which wasn't hard since it is a bit chilly outside).

After reassembling everything using the [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com) guide and applying some [thermal compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_grease), we booted the Mac and... surprise it was working!

If the MacBook works for a few months or 1 year, it will be worth it for sure, since the only cost was the the [thermal compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_grease) and time.

Good luck if you want to try to do the same.
