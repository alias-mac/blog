I'm that kind of guy that is always taking and making notes about everything I
have on my headâ€¦ so I started using [Mou](http://mouapp.com) since it helps me
to "code" my notes. This makes my life easier when I need to share it using some
nice formatting of my mental notes.

Now with mountain lion you can also use the Notes app (that comes built in), but
for me that is more like shopping list ðŸ™‚

Go ahead and try Mou, you'll be pleased.
