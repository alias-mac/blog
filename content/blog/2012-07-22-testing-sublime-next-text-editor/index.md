I normally use [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org) to develop on PHP, since it
became very good on version 7.1 (I was using
[Zend Studio](http://www.zend.com/en/products/studio/) previously).

For a quick view or editing a file I normally use
[TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/). It's also nice
to compare files when diff is messing things up and thinks we are changing
functions instead adding them. So you can scroll and compare by having the lines
at the same level and also do a bunch of stuff to help you out. Anyway, I was
testing, again, [Textmate](http://macromates.com) to see if it was worthy of the
â‚¬45.63 they ask for it... I mean, I need just for "quick fix" and not to develop
on it. Before I even decide anything, I saw this
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) and just for the demonstration they
have online, I think it's amazing.

For now it's free and I can even use the command line to call for it by making a
link on my local binaries:

```bash
ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/
```

It has a lot of nice features like code navigation with shortcuts, grids to have
groups of files side by side, among other great features.

One of the features I would like to see in these editors is the "replace
variable" (like refactor on [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org)) because
[Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com) uses an incremental selection of the
variable selected, and that might go out of the scope of the refactor that you
are doing. I know that you can use the replace only in the selected piece of
code (in almost any editor), but it's not the same thing.
