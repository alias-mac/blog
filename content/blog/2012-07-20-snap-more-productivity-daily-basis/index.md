[BetterSnapTool](http://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=2342) is a very nice app to
have it. You can put windows side by side by just snapping them to the left,
right, top left corner, etc..

I still prefer the [BetterTouchTool](http://www.boastr.de) because I can create
some special gestures which help me using my magic mouse (when I do) to paste
using the middle click to the terminal (yes magic mouse doesn't have it, but
using this app you can create it). The UX of the app it's a little bit confusing
for non techies, but once you understand how it works, it's magical.

I just can't live without it! Thanks Andreas Hegenberg, great app!
